Release Notes - P3 Sample Application

0.8:
- Added Sample Module Driver VS project
- Added Simple Diagnostics Unity project to help create and simulate module features in diagnostics
- Reworked module driver documentation based on above additions
- Refactored SDK zip file
- Enabled new framework replay feature (Added example setting overrides in P3SASettingsMode.cs, but didn't add local handling of an achieved replay)
- Added LED simulation support (select Display8 in Unity)
- Fixed a playlist bug in P3SAAudio.cs
- Added Multimorphic prefixes to some logging messages to avoid a compiler error after renaming the project to a non-Multimorphic company
- Removed odd numbered trough entries from the default sim states dictionary
- Changed high score entry buttons so 'start' is exit/back and 'launch' is select.
- Commented out instantiation of inlane/outlane transition prefabs in LanesManager, as those prefabs aren't part of the SDK
- Enable BumpersMode by default
- Changed HomeMode's drain event handler to call EndOfBall, which posts Evt_BallEnded, instead of directly calling End(), which is intended to be called only when the mode is stopped.  This allows the programmer to do other things as a result of EndOfBall but before stopping HomeMode.
- Added BaseGameMode option to show end of ball bonus even if tilt is active
- Added Chase Ball enable to optionally disable chase balls from ball search (useful in tournaments)
